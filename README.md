# MoCChA
Mathematics on Computers for Chemistry Applications (MoCChA) is a collection of active learning assignments to help Chemistry majors master math techniques required to tackle Chemistry problems. MoCChA features a collection of team activities (see 'handouts' folder) and Jupyter notebooks for web-based simulations and visualization (see 'jupyter' folder). The notebooks are work in progress, please feel free to contact me if you have additions or suggestions!
